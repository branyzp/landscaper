    <H1 id="intro">Welcome to God of Landscaping, an interactive Role-Playing Game where you play as the Heroic
        Landscaper.
        <br>
        <br>
        Your aim isn't to save a princess, defeat a villain or rescue a village.
        <br>
        <br>
        Your aim is to earn as much as money as possible. That's right. This is one of the most realistic games you can
        ever play.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, go forth and use whatever you can to earn as much as you can. Probably through landscaping or something,
        then invest it all into the S&P500, also known as adulting.
